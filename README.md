# Zweihammer Extras

This module is a collection of extensions and tweaks for Foundry VTT and
Zweih채nder system, created to help me with running my private games. The
extensions are highly subjective, and I believe they have no place in "official"
system implementation. Also, I ran Zweih채nder games in Warhammer Fantasy
setting, and these extensions may address my specific
preferences/conventions/home rules, etc., so they may not make sense in
typical Zweih채nder game.

On the other hand I share this, because maybe you will find something useful for
you, or at least some inspiration.

You have been warned.

## Module contents

- Quick Profile panel - heavily inspired by
  [foundry-action-pack](https://github.com/teroparvinen/foundry-action-pack), it
  adds a tray on the left displaying selected token's profile in a form similar
  to the one used in Zweih채nder rulebook
